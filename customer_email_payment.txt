Dear Customer Service Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the gym's payment policy in the event that a payment is declined.

I recently received a notification from my bank that my gym membership payment was declined due to insufficient funds. While I have already taken care of the issue with my bank, I wanted to know what happens in such cases if I am unable to resolve the issue immediately.

Will my gym membership be cancelled immediately, or will I have some time to resolve the payment issue before any action is taken? Will I be charged any additional fees or penalties in such cases?

I would appreciate it if you could clarify the gym's policy on declined payments and any relevant procedures or steps that I should be aware of. I value my gym membership and would like to ensure that my membership is not affected due to any payment issues.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
