Subject: Personal Trainer Costs

Dear Customer Service Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am a member of the gym and I have been looking to start a personal training program to help me achieve my fitness goals. However, I would like to inquire about the costs associated with personal training sessions.

Can you please provide me with information on the costs of personal training sessions at the gym? Are there different pricing options for different types of personal training programs or trainers? How many sessions are typically recommended for a beginner, and what is the duration of each session?

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any promotions or discounts available for personal training packages or for members who have been with the gym for a certain period of time.

I appreciate your help and look forward to hearing back from you soon. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
