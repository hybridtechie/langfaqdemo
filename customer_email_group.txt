Subject: Guest Passes for Group Fitness Classes

Dear Customer Service Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am a member of the gym and I have been thoroughly enjoying the group fitness classes. I wanted to inquire about the gym's policy on bringing guests to the classes.

I have a friend who is interested in trying out some of the group fitness classes, and I was wondering if I can bring her as my guest to one of the classes. Do you offer guest passes for group fitness classes? If so, what is the process for obtaining a guest pass and are there any associated fees?

I understand that there may be some restrictions on the number of guests or specific classes where guests are allowed. Can you please provide me with any relevant details so that I can ensure that my friend and I comply with the gym's policies?

Thank you in advance for your help. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
